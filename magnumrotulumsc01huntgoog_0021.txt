PREFACR

which the most remarkable is that which is to be
found at p.189 of the present volume, where we have
Brientius filius Comitis rendering accompt of the
Auxilium Burgi of Warengeford, which he does in
the following terms:
xv. li. de veteri auxilio burgi tercii anni:
xv. li. de auxilio burgi preteriti anni:
xv. li. de novo auxilio burgi.
There is another in nearly the same terms at p.77.
Upon these entries he appears to have reasoned
thus :-We have here the accompt of the present
year, of the last past, and the one immediately
preceding, which is called the third year of some
King's reign: hence the accompts are of the Fisth
year of some reign; and since the persons named in
them are all people who llourished in the former half
of the twelsth century, and as the fifth of Henry

’ the First is too early and the fisth of Henry the

Second too late, we must come to the conclusion that

this is the roll of the Fisth year of King Stephen. Ι
No doubt the inference was good were but the

ei premises sound. But the tercii anni in the above

quotation does not necessarily require to be taken in
the sense of the Third year of any King's reign:
but, according to the usage in these accompts, may
as well be the Third year, reckoning backward, from
the year in which the accompts were taken. This
is shown at large hy Madox in his Letter to Lord
Somers, by numerous citatione from the rolls of
Henry the Second and Richard. One instance will
be sufficient. In the roll of the Eleventh year of
King Henry 11, in the accompt for Hampshire,
Hugo de Gundovill stands indebted
