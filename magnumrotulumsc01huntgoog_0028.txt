The accompts in the Exchequer are made up to ιιιοιι ..rupo
the twenty· ·ninth day of September 1n each year. ³¹ ΗΜ Ι
My position is, that these are the accompts of the
year ending in 1180, September 99. This day falling
“ within the thirty-first year of the reign of Henry
the First, the roll would according to the usual
practice be called the roll of that year, although the
affairs treated of in it would occur for the most part
in the thirtieth year of that King's reign, his reign
commencing on or about the fifth day of August

That these accompts do not belong to an earlier oso unp 3‘
period may be inferred with the highest confidence²¹²¹³
from the frequent occurrence of the Bishop of Win-
chester as acting in the King’s affairs. The only
difficulty in this case arises from the circumstance, ·
that in no instance does the name of the Bishop ap.-
pear; and it might be askcd whether it was William
Giffard, or Henry of Blois, who is the Bisbop in-
tended. But while the probability is greatly in favour
of Henry, who was the King’s nephew, the son of
his sister Adela, this is rendered certain, by what is
found ιιι the accompts tsof the Sheriff of Devonshire,

p. 156. where a discharge rs entered to the Abbey pervorans
of Glastonbury, of which Henry was the Abbot, ol' wrm ww οἶ
seven marks, because the pleas had been‘ ‘before
the Bishop had the Abbey.” The Bishop of Win-

chester had been mentioned just before. Now,
Henry of Blois, the Abbot of Glastonbury, was not
appointed to the Bishoprick of Winchester before
October, 11‘293 and his consecration took place on
the seventeenth day of November following·

Alimitation' ιιι the other directron may be gatbered gramma 'm meg

out of what rs said of Herveius the Bishop of Ely.
He renders accompt of seven marks of gold anda
