PREFACE.

England, which became at length, as it still continues,
a-fief of the Crown : the honour of Pontefract. The
original grantae was an ilbert de Laci‚ whose great
possessions are described in Domesday Book. From
him descended other Lacis, who held this fee till the
reign of Richard L, when Robert the last of them
deceased without issue. On his death the fee de·
scended to Albreda de Lizours, of whom there exists
aFine of the fifth year of King Richard showing her
in possession, and to whom she disposed of it. 'The
question is how Albreda stood related to the Laci
last seised3 and Dugdale‚ together with the whole
body of later genealogists, have followed the Historia
Laceiorum, an historical fragment written not ear-
lier than the time of King Henry VI.‚ printed in
the Monasticon from a Chartulary. The writer of
this little pieee of history declares Albreda to have
been half-sister ex parte materna to the last of the
Lacis. Butes this would show a rule of descent of
which it is presumed no similar instance can be pro·
duced from those times, and might if admitted lead
to general conclusions that were erroneous in respect
to the inheritance of feudal tenures under the early
monarchy, it is of importance to observe that in this
roll there is an entryin the accompts sor Nottingham-
sbire and Derbyshire that Robert de Lizours paid
sl. bs. sd. that he might take to wife the sister ol
Ilbert de Laci, a second of that ri'ame3 and there
can scarcely be a doubt that Albreda was the issue
of that marriage, was cousin and heir,' not half-sister
and heir, of the last of the Lacis, and thereforea
partaher of the blood of the Ilbert de Laci who was
the original grantee from the Conqueror.
emnam, Itis proper to add that when the Commission on
. the Public Records did me the honour to call in my

assistance in the performance of the important labours
