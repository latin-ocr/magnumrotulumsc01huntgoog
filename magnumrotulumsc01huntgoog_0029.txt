PREFACE.

· ael,000 that the Knights of the Bishoprick of Ely

may keep ward in the lsle of Ely as is done at the

Castle of Norwich. These entries plainly show that y
· Herveius was alive when these accompts were

rendered: yet the time of his death, according to l

the Obituary of the Church of Ely and other autho- χ
rities, was the year 1131, on the soth day of August ²¹*
This is the time of his death generally received. It
must however be added, that one Chronicler places

his death in 1133.

Again, Ranulf Flambard, the Bishop of Durham,
n died on the 5th of September 1128. The King did
“ , not immediately appoint a successor3 but held the
bishoprick in his own hands for nearly five years.
The carc of the revenucs he committed to John de
Amundeville, and Geffery Escolland. The words
of the Continuabor of Simeon are express :-Eo
autem defuncto, committitur Episcopatus duobus
Beronibus, videlicet Johanni de Amundivilla, et
Gaufrido seniori Escolland ad opus Regis censum
colligentibus.† The accompts of the Bishoprick of
Durham in the roll are in exact accordance with
this. We find Escollandus renden'ng the accompt,
. p.130: and John de Amundeville assistant to him.
The King takes the balance of the revenue aster
*certain payments to other persons. This is amply
sufficient to prove that the roll belongs to some
one year during the period when the revenues of
the see were rendered by Escollandus to the King.
But more than this is proved: for Escollandus, it
will be observed makes three distinct returns 2-
· first, of the nova firma Episcopatus: second, of the
vetus firma Episcopatus preteriti anni :-and lastly,
of the remanens firma Episcopatus de tempore

ἢ Madox, vol. ii. p. 4⁷4.
