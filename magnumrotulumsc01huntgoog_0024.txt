PREFACE.

London, wherein there is an allowance demanded
by the Sheriffs of London, de oleo ad ardend. ante
sepulchrum Reginae, et de pannis super sepulchrum
Reginae3 to wit, of Queen Maude, King Heury the I.
his first wife, who died and was interred at W est·
minster, in his 18 year, anno dom. 1118. And like-
wise hythe Oblata, fines, summes due and paid to
the King from Hervoeus Bishop of Ely, in' this
great roll, in Grentzburgeschira, for himself and his
nephew‚ whose see of Ely was first erected and
himself created first Bishop thereof by King Henry
the 1., an. 1109, being the 9th year of his reign, he
deceasing two years before King Henry I.‚ and seven
years before the 5th of King Stephen, who usurped
the Crown, as our historians expressly relate.”* .

The argument is good against the opinion which
assigns this roll to the reign of Stephon: and as
Pryune’s volume was published in 1668, and the

, Baronage not till 1675, it is surprising that Dugdale
should not have heard of this refutation, or that
having heard of it, he should persist in quoting this
Record as of the Fiflh of Stephen, and occasionally
making deductione from it as belonging to that year.
Prynne however has failed to prove that it belongs
to the eighteenth year of Henry the F irst: the pay· caueamus-
ment of the city ofLondon for lights at the Queen’s Μ’ ’
Sepulchre being Annual‚ occurring in several other
of the early rolls in the same form, and being to the
same amounu which indeed Prynne only two pages
before had himself been led to observe.

*One fact from amongst many, may be stated as Retuted·
containing what is wholly inconsistentwith this early
date. The name of Alexander Bisho'p of Lincoln
occurs in the roll, at p.lll, and 114, of the present
