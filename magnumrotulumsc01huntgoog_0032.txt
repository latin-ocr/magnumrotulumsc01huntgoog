PREFACE.

Robert de Betun took place, according to Godwin‚

in 1131, the 19th day of June.
While there rs mention of every Bishop who was 111111 111111
living 1n 1180, and many of them are mentioned 11011118 '⁸⁵

many times, no Bishop of Carlisle occurs. Why?

The see was not founded till 1182.

. Frequent allusion is made to the King’s absence 1118111111
in Normandy. Henry went thither in the August ¹¹¹N⁰³¹¹³⁰dl¹
. of 1130; but 1 previous visit in the years 1128 and

1129 may be that to which reference 1s made.

Agnes de Belfago 1s fined 85 marks of 111101,1111111ο11

because her son had gone to the Earl 01 Flanders, ξ’,ζο ¹ ⁰f¹l¹⁸¹¹'

p. 98. The Earl was the King's enemy in 1128.

There 1s reference to the coming of 1111Ε111011110011010010010111111
10 England, p. 157, which was probably when shethe
came with the King from Normandy m 1127.

The King 01 Scotland had not long before been 1·1 0100001010ῑὲ100

11 the English Court. The Chronicle 01 Ma1lros 1 18
fixes the time 01 the visit to the Christmas 011127,
, when he took the oath 01 allegiance to the Empress.
The Saxon Chronicle says, that he remained a whole
year, and was received by the King with great
Ἴ worship. This is confirmed by the entries of pay-
ments to him on the King’s account by the Sheriffs
of the Shires through which he had passed.

The accompts 01 Randolf Earl 01131011111111101111000100111
Lucy Countess 01 Chester, p. 100, are evidently ofc al. pilas
persons newly m possession. The former Earl
Randolf, husband 01 theone, and father 01 the other,
died in 1128, 01 1129, forthere is some uncertainty
respecting the time.

Each of these facts would of itself create a pro-
bability more or less cogent in favour 01 the year to
which this roll is now assigned: and Ι trust that the
combined effect of the whole will be to leave no
