ffifflss' The question was taken up early in the last ¹
century by Madox, the author of the History and
Antiquities of the Exchequer. He so far condescende ³
to the opinion which preveiled in his time, that he
quotes the roll throughout that truly learned and

admirable work, as the roll of the Fisth of Stephon,

though he bas annexed to that History his Letter to
[ord Somers, in which he shows that it cannot belong
to that year, and that it is in fact a roll of the reign
of Henry the First. It is a proof of the candour
and cantion of that distinguished antiquary, that he
has allowed the question there to rest without attempt·
ing to fix any particular year of that reign as that
in which these accompts were made up. The writer
of this Preface may owe an apology to the public,
that he has ventured to advance a step further3 and
it is due to himself to state, that aster such an ex-
ample of forbearance on the part of so distinguished
. aman, it bas not been without some reluctance that
he has placed in the title page of this Volume a par·
ticular year as that to which these accompts are to
be referred. However‚ the grounds of the opinion
will now be faithfully exhibited: and the Record
itself being printed and made public, is so open to
the view and study of all men, that no error on such
a point as this can remain long undetected. Besides
he has the satisfaction of finding the conclusion to
which his own study of the Record has led him so
nearly coincident with that of so great a critic in our
early histories as the present Keeper of the Records
at the Tower, who in apreface to a private publica-
tion of a N orman Pipe Roll, has a passing notice of
the roll before us, in which he assigns it to the
twenty-ninth or thirtieth year of King Henry Ι.
