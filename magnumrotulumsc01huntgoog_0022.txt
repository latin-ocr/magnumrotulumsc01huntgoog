PREFACE. ,

Iadd what is not observed by Madox‚ that the
roll itself contains one decisive proof that the mode
of reckoning the years was not by the number of the
years of the reign, but by reckoning the years back-
ward from the then present year. It isin the curious
accompts of the city of Carlisle at plal, where we
have persons rendering accompt of the Geldum
Animalium for five years, the years before the pre-
sent being thus described :-

preteriti anni
tercii anni

quarti anni

quinti anni.
At the same time, though fully acquiescing in the
conclusion of Madox and the soundness of the mode
of proof used by him, in justice to the older antiquary

it must be observed, that the principle on which he
understood that the Scribas proceeded in denomi-
nating the years for which accompts were rendered,
when the accompts extended backward into several

precedent years, was a principle soon afterwards
adopted by them. Of this the roll of the Third of

King John lately published from the Chaucellor’s
Antigraph, afiords the most palpable evidence: for
we find the Earl of Leicester there rendering accompt
of the firmos Belgrave for five yearS, which years
are designated thus :-hoc anno-preterito anuo-
anno primo—anno decimo-anno nouo ε* the nume-

rals plainly indicating the years of the reign of John,
and of his predecessor, Richard.

That the Record cannot belong to the Fifth year
of King Stephen may be evinced by the following cprnron
facts 2-(1.) In the fifth of King Stephen the country ”sm
was convulscd by the efforts of the two parties nearly
