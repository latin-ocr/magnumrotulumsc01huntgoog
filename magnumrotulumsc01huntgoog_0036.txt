PREFACE.

committed to their charge, a considerable portion of
this Roll was already finished at the press. The first
, and the last sheets indeed alone remaincd; but Ι
have performed the duty of an Editor in respect of
the whole Roll, hy having gone through a minute
and exact collation with the original record, so that
the text when taken in connection with the Corri-
genda at p. 168 of this volume, may he received as a
faithful representation of the original by the historical
enquirer‚ to whose studies and researches the valuable
information contained in this Record is now happily
opened, without encountering the difficulties which
must always have attended a personal search in the
office in which it is deposited, and without that waste
of life to which former antiquarios have been subject

in the necessity of personal transcription.
