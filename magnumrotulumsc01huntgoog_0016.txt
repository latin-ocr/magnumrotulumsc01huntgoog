PREFACE. v

The wonder rather is, that so much should have· omasum

lest to conjecture, in the silence of history and the
absence of evidence. But that this was not always
an insulated and solitary document, that there were
in fact rolls extending through the whole reign of

Madox, says, that he had himself inspected a few of
the Annual Rolls of that reign.
