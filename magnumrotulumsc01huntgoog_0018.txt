PREFACE.

is sofar at variance with truth and probability that
it would scarcely deservo a serious refutation.

The proof that this is not the true date arises (1.) nenas
from the utter want of any correspondency with the
roll ol' the Second year of King Henry the Second,
while in two contignous rolls of annual accompts
there must needs be such correspondency, debts
from a former year being brought forward in the ac·
compts of that which succeeds: (a.) the list of
Sheriffs of the Counties in the First year of King
Henry the Second, in the Red Book ofthe Exchequer,
differs entirely from the Sheriffs as they appear in
this record: (3.) many persons occur as then active
in the King's service, or as possessing'ecclesiastical
dignitieS, concerning whom there is the whole current
of history, shewing that they were dead long before
the accession of King Henry the Second. On the
whole, this date can be regarded in no other light
than as the ,hasty conclusion of some unknown per-
son, who finding a series of rolls commencing with
the Second year of the reign of one of our Kings,
and an unappropriated roll beside, concluded that
this must be the roll that was required to make the
series of that reign complete.

When the attention of the Antiquaries of England
began to be directed on this document as one of the
sources of historical knowledge, the error of the
office-date was soon discovered, and the roll itself
is now made to protest against it. On a slip of ,
parchment attached to the roll, and in a modern

hand, the following refutation of the old opinion is
written, and at the same time a proposal is made of

another year as that to which the record is to be ano opinion:
referred :-The Filih year of King Stephon. ⁵strvh-
