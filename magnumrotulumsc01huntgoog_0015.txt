In some os the rolla, the edges are in part worn away,
or the writing is become illegible. When Dodsworth
perused the roll, and made his excerpts from it, afew
passages were legible to him which are not legible
now: yet it has evidently been preserved with the
care which so antient and venerable a document de-
serves‚ and means have lately been taken forits still
better conservation.

fourth roll is now the only loss which is apparent,
there is too much reason to thinh that several small
rolls, which originally made up the Great Roll, have
not descended to our times. Of some of the coun-
ties there are no returns at all; and of others only
slight notices, and by no means those ample returns
which we find made from other counties. The
counties which are thus omitted, or only imperfectly
noticed, are these: somerset, Worcester, llereford,
Salop, chester, Lancaster, Westmorland, Cumber·
land, and the Bishoprick of Durham. ln the rolls
of later date the returns from these counties corres-
pond with those from the rest of the kingdom: and
though, with respect to some of these counties‚ a
plausible conjecture might be proposed to account
for the absence of thern, no plausible reason can be
assigned sor the absence of others; so that we are
driven to the conclusion that this Great Roll has at
some period been deprived of a few of the rotulets
of which it once consisted.

This mutilation must be referred to a remote
period. In the time of Madox it consisted of the
same number of rolls as at present3 and it may be
inferred from the extracts made from it by the ’
Antiquaries of the seventeenth century, thatin their
time the roll consisted of no more than it does at
present.
