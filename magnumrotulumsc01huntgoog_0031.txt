suppose that be was not elected before the yearllw,
we should bave another limitation equally powerhrl
with that created hythe date of the mosecration of
the Bishop of winchester. Matthew Paris fixes the
time of his election to 11300: and so likewise does
Ordericus 2—Eodem anno (1130) Hugo Ambianensis
Monachus Cluniacensis, Abbas Radingensis, factus
est Archiepiscopus‘ Rothomagensis.† But the
authors of the Gallia Christiana contend that he
was elected Archbisbop some time before, audit
appears to bc certain that his predecessor died as
early as 1128, the 28th day of November. It is

manifest, however, that no Hugh Archbishop of Ἴ

Rouen oould appear in any accompts made up in
a September, before 1129: auditis highly probable
that the moneys paid to him at London and at
Winchester were royal gitis made to this great

favourite of the King, in 1130, before he went to

Normandy with the King to be invested with all the
ensigns of his dignity.

These then are the grounds on which the opi·
nion rests, that we have here the accompts from
September 1129, to the same month in 1130. On
an impartial perusal of the record Ι have found
nothing which is in variance with this conclusion,
while there are several other circumstances, which,
though not of a nature ιο fix the record to any

particular year, are yet in striking correspondency
with what is known of the period just preceding the
September of 1180. ·
