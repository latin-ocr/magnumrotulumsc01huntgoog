The accompts in the Exchequer are made up to ιιιιιι ιιιιριοιι
the twenty· -ninth day of September ιιι each year. ³¹ H‘n ¹
My position is, that these are the accompts of the
year ending in 1130, September Q9. This day falling
within the thirty-first year of the reign of Henry
the First, the roll would according to the usual
practice be called the roll of that year, although the
affairs treated of in it would occur for the most part
in the thirtieth year of that King’s reign, his reign
commencing on or about the fifth day of August

That these accompts do not belong to an earlier οἳ ξω(

period may be inserted with the highest conlidenca‘¹¹¹³
from the frequent occurrence of the Bishop of Win-
chester as acting in the King’s affairs. The only
difficulty in this case arises srom the circumstance, ⁴

thatin 'no instance does the name of the Bishop ap-
pear3 and it might be asked whether it was William
Giffard, or Henry of Blois, who is the Bishop in-
tended. But while the probability is greatly in favour
of Henry, who was the King's nephew, the son of
his sister Adela‚ this is rendered certain, by what is
found 1n the accompts ol the Sheriff of Devonshire,
p. 156. where a discharge rs entered to the Abbey uenryoraua
of Glastonbury, of which Henry was the Abbot, of tvmfflff ὦ
seven marks, because the pleas had been‘ ‘before
the Bishop had the Abbey.” The Bishop ο1 Win-
chester had been mentioned just before. Now,
Henry of Blois, the Abbot of Glastonbury, was not
appointed to the Bishoprick of Winchester before
October, 11293 and his consecration took place on
the seventeenth day of November following.

Alimitation m the other direction may be gathered ιιιιιιι mann
out of what rs said of Herveius the Bishop of Ely. ΒΜ Μ’
He renders accompt of seven marks of gold anda

half, pro ministerio Willi nepotis sui: and again of
