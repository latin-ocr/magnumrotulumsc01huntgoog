notice of this individual roll, yet that he was a dili-
gent student among the records of the Exchequer

numerous extracta made from Exchequer necorde,
which are now, in his own hand, among the manu-

’ the particular passage to which his attention should
be directed. The probability is, as is observed by
Madox, that he had in view a few passages in which
there is mention made of more 'than one year: of
